# EVAL-3

# Client:
We're about to go on vacation, take advantage of it to finish the project. This time, you won't be using CSV files anymore. We're now going to migrate to a real DB and verify that all you need, according to your design, is to modify the query classes, CRUDRegistros, and Connection.

## Requirements:
 |Non-Functional|Functional|
 |--------------|----------|
 |NF01: Migrate to DB (Finally) |F01: Make the necessary changes to the query, CRUDRegistros, and Connection classes |
 
 ## Limitations:
 - Cannot use frameworks [java vanilla]
 - Cannot modify Models and Controllers [It could happen in case of fixing something but it shouldn't]
 
 ## Notes:
- You might be excited that now you'll be able to use a database instead of having to struggle with everything using files. Well, I just wanted to remind you that now you also have to build the View.
